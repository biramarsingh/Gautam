<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
<p>
It is very easy to create a beatiful website. 
Simply sign up to one of the many free website builder and  in minutes you can have a sleek web design and attractive looking site.
You would be excused in thinking  that this is an effective web design. But the fact is,although a website may look good,it can be far from funtional 
and suited for the users needs.
